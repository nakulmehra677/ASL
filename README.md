Having problem in english? Problem while understanding the sentences? This android app contains many types of sentences that explains how to convert hindi sentences to english. This app gives proper identification, explanation, rules and examples to show where it can be used in details.

In the first page there is a list of chapters, by clicking on that you will get all the details. Since, I have not released it publicly, I have also added floating action button to add more chapters in it and still, I am adding the chapters in it.

Currently, I am working in this app to improve and add new features in it.
